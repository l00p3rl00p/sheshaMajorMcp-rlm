# Shesha Clean Room Installer

The portable wavefront for Shesha RLM. This directory provides a "Just Works" installation experience for human operators and automated agents, ensuring a clean and isolated environment across any repository fork.

## 🚀 Quick Start (60s)

To install headlessly (for agents/CI):
```bash
python serverinstaller/install.py --headless
```

To install selectively (guided inventory):
```bash
python serverinstaller/install.py
```

## 🛠 Features

- **Portability**: Standalone directory. Bootstraps from host tools and local workspace.
- **Inventory Awareness**: Scans for Python, Node, and Docker; offers selective installation.
- **Surgical Reversal**: Clean uninstall including marker-aware shell configuration cleanup.
- **Wide compatibility**: Logic hardened for Python 3.9+ environments.
- **MCP Bridge**: Wrap legacy code as MCP servers and auto-attach to IDEs.

## 🌉 MCP Bridge (New!)

**Turn any code into AI-accessible tools:**

```bash
# Attach existing MCP server to your IDEs
python install.py --attach-to all

# Wrap legacy script + attach to Claude
python install.py --generate-bridge --attach-to claude

# Detect available IDEs
python attach.py --detect
```

## 💡 Philosophy: Not Every Repo Is a Product

The installer understands that **not every directory with code needs to be a full-blown installable package.**

### The Spectrum of Code
```
Simple Script ─────────── Tool ─────────── Full Product
mcp_injector.py      Shesha CLI      Shesha RLM (Server + GUI)
```

When you run `python serverinstaller/install.py`, the installer **detects** what kind of repo it's in:

**Simple Script Detected:**
```
Options:
  1. Create install.sh wrapper (lightweight, recommended)
  2. Package as full Python project (pyproject.toml + .venv)
  3. Exit (leave as-is)
```

**Design Principles:**
- **Respect Minimalism**: Don't force a `.venv` on a script that doesn't need one
- **Offer Transition Paths**: Simple scripts can be "upgraded" to full packages later
- **Enable Portability**: Whether it's a `.sh` wrapper or full package, the result is copy-pasteable

> *"The best installer is the one that knows when to do nothing."*


## ⚙️ Key Arguments

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--headless` | Bypass all interactive prompts (agent mode). |
| `--no-gui` | Skip GUI/NPM installation phase. |
| `--npm-policy {local,global,auto}` | Control Node/NPM isolation. |
| `--docker-policy {skip,fail}` | Define behavior if Docker is missing. |

## 🔌 Bonus: MCP JSON Injector

**Standalone tool for adding MCP servers to any IDE config file.**

```bash
# Install (from repo root)
./mcp_injector_install.sh

# Use
mcp-inject --client claude --add    # Interactive mode
mcp-inject --list-clients            # Show all IDE locations
```

See [MCP_INJECTOR_README.md](../MCP_INJECTOR_README.md) for details.
