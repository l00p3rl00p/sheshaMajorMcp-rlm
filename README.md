# Shesha

**Recursive Language Models for Document Querying**

Shesha implements [Recursive Language Models (RLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24601) - a technique for querying document collections by having an LLM write Python code to explore them in a sandboxed REPL.

[Shesha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shesha), also known as Ananta, is a Hindu deity who embodies the concept of infinity and the eternal cycle of existence. He is famously depicted with a thousand heads that support the planets of the universe, representing a foundational stability that allows for the maintenance of vast, complex structures. As the celestial couch of the preserver deity Vishnu, he remains constant even as the world undergoes cycles of creation and dissolution, mirroring the ability of recursive models to manage essentially unbounded-length reasoning chains.

See [Sample Session](#sample-session) at the end for a demo of complex multi-document reasoning.

## Alpha Code

So far it seems to work, but it's only been tested with .txt documents and the OpenAI API. It _should_ support PDFs, Work Documents, and other files. Your mileage may very.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Docker (for sandbox execution)
- An LLM API key (or local Ollama installation)

## Supported LLM Providers

Shesha uses [LiteLLM](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) under the hood, giving you access to 100+ LLM providers with a unified interface:

| Provider | Example Model | Environment Variable |
|----------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Anthropic** | `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| **OpenAI** | `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4-turbo` | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| **Google** | `gemini/gemini-1.5-pro` | `GEMINI_API_KEY` |
| **Ollama** | `ollama/llama3`, `ollama/mistral` | (local, no key needed) |
| **Azure** | `azure/gpt-4` | `AZURE_API_KEY` |
| **AWS Bedrock** | `bedrock/anthropic.claude-3` | AWS credentials |

See the [LiteLLM documentation](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) for the full list of supported providers.

### Using Ollama (Local Models)

Run models locally with no API key required:

```bash
# Start Ollama
ollama serve

# Pull a model
ollama pull llama3

# Use with Shesha
shesha = Shesha(model="ollama/llama3")
```

## Installation

### From PyPI (when published)

```bash
pip install shesha
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ovid/shesha.git
cd shesha

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install with dev dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Build the Sandbox Container

The sandbox container is required for code execution:

```bash
docker build -t shesha-sandbox -f src/shesha/sandbox/Dockerfile src/shesha/sandbox/
```

Verify the build:

```bash
echo '{"action": "ping"}' | docker run -i --rm shesha-sandbox
# Should output: {"status": "ok", "message": "pong"}
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Set your API key and optionally configure other settings:

```bash
export SHESHA_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
export SHESHA_MODEL="claude-sonnet-4-20250514"  # Default model
export SHESHA_STORAGE_PATH="./shesha_data"      # Where projects are stored
export SHESHA_POOL_SIZE="3"                     # Warm container count
export SHESHA_MAX_ITERATIONS="20"               # Max RLM iterations
```

### Programmatic Configuration

```python
from shesha import Shesha, SheshaConfig

# Anthropic Claude
shesha = Shesha(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514")

# OpenAI GPT-4
shesha = Shesha(model="gpt-4o", api_key="your-openai-key")

# Google Gemini
shesha = Shesha(model="gemini/gemini-1.5-pro", api_key="your-gemini-key")

# Ollama (local, no API key needed)
shesha = Shesha(model="ollama/llama3")

# Full configuration
config = SheshaConfig(
    model="gpt-4-turbo",
    api_key="your-openai-key",
    storage_path="./data",
    pool_size=3,
    max_iterations=30,
)
shesha = Shesha(config=config)

# Load from file
config = SheshaConfig.from_file("config.yaml")
shesha = Shesha(config=config)
```

### Config File Format (YAML)

```yaml
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250514
storage_path: ./my_data
pool_size: 5
max_iterations: 25
container_memory_mb: 1024
execution_timeout_sec: 60
```

## Quick Start

```python
from shesha import Shesha

# Initialize (uses SHESHA_API_KEY from environment)
shesha = Shesha(model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514")

# Create a project and upload documents
project = shesha.create_project("research")
project.upload("papers/", recursive=True)
project.upload("notes.md")

# Query the documents
result = project.query("What are the main findings?")
print(result.answer)

# Inspect execution details
print(f"Completed in {result.execution_time:.2f}s")
print(f"Tokens used: {result.token_usage.total_tokens}")

# View the execution trace
for step in result.trace.steps:
    print(f"[{step.type.value}] {step.content[:100]}...")
```

## Try the Example

The repo includes an interactive example that lets you query the Barsoom novels (Edgar Rice Burroughs' Mars series, public domain):

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory with venv activated
cd shesha
source .venv/bin/activate

# Set your API key
export SHESHA_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Optional: specify a model (defaults to claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
export SHESHA_MODEL="gpt-4o"  # or claude-sonnet-4-20250514, gemini/gemini-1.5-pro, etc.

# Run the interactive explorer
python examples/barsoom.py
```

On first run, it uploads the 7 Barsoom novels to a local project. Then you can ask questions:

```
> Who is Dejah Thoris?
[Thought for 12 seconds]
Dejah Thoris is the Princess of Helium and the primary love interest of John Carter...

> What weapons are commonly used on Barsoom?
[Thought for 8 seconds]
The Martians use a variety of weapons including...
```

Use `--verbose` for execution stats, or `--prompt "question"` for non-interactive mode:

```bash
python examples/barsoom.py --verbose
python examples/barsoom.py --prompt "How does John Carter travel to Mars?"
```

## Analyzing Codebases

Shesha can ingest entire git repositories for deep code analysis with accurate file:line citations:

```python
from shesha import Shesha

with Shesha() as s:
    # Ingest a GitHub repository
    result = s.create_project_from_repo(
        url="https://github.com/org/repo",
        token="ghp_xxxxx",  # Optional, for private repos
    )

    print(f"Status: {result.status}")
    print(f"Files ingested: {result.files_ingested}")

    # Query the codebase
    answer = result.project.query("How does authentication work?")
    print(answer.answer)  # Includes file:line citations

    # Update when changes are available
    if result.status == "updates_available":
        result = result.apply_updates()
```

The codebase analyzer:
- Supports GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and local git repos
- Uses shallow clones for efficiency
- Tracks SHA for change detection
- Formats code with line numbers for accurate citations
- Handles various encodings via `chardet`
- Detects language from file extensions and shebangs

### Repository Explorer CLI

For interactive codebase exploration, use the `repo.py` example script:

```bash
# Set your API key
export SHESHA_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Optional: specify a model (defaults to claude-sonnet-4-20250514)
export SHESHA_MODEL="gpt-4o"  # or gemini/gemini-1.5-pro, ollama/llama3, etc.

# Explore a GitHub repository
python examples/repo.py https://github.com/org/repo

# Explore a local git repository
python examples/repo.py /path/to/local/repo

# Run without arguments to see a picker of previously indexed repos
python examples/repo.py
```

The picker mode lets you select from previously indexed repositories or enter a new URL:

```
Available repositories:
  1. org-repo
  2. another-project

Enter number or new repo URL: 1
Loading project: org-repo

Ask questions about the codebase. Type "quit" or "exit" to leave.

> How does authentication work?
[Thought for 15 seconds]
Authentication is handled in src/auth/handler.py:42...
```

Command line options:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--update` | Auto-apply updates without prompting when changes are detected |
| `--verbose` | Show execution stats (time, tokens, trace) after each answer |

```bash
# Auto-update and show stats
python examples/repo.py https://github.com/org/repo --update --verbose
```

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: Documents are parsed and stored in a project
2. **Query**: Your question is sent to the LLM with a sandboxed Python REPL
3. **Explore**: The LLM writes Python code to analyze documents (available as `context`)
4. **Execute**: Code runs in an isolated Docker container
5. **Iterate**: LLM sees output, writes more code, repeats until confident
6. **Answer**: LLM calls `FINAL("answer")` to return the result

For large documents, the LLM can use `llm_query(instruction, content)` to delegate analysis to a sub-LLM call.

## Sample Session

Here's a real session querying the Barsoom novels, demonstrating three key capabilities:

1. **Guardrails** - Politely refuses out-of-scope questions while explaining why
2. **Simple lookup** - Quick fact retrieval from the document collection
3. **Complex multi-document reasoning** - Tracks events across 7 books, orders them chronologically, cites supporting quotes, and identifies continuity conflicts

```
$ python examples/barsoom.py

Ask questions about the Barsoom series. Type "quit" or "exit" to leave.

> What is the capital of Malawi?
[Thought for 7 seconds]
The documents provided are Barsoom (Mars) texts and do not contain information
about Malawi. I can't find the capital of Malawi in the provided documents.

> Who is the son of Dejah Thoris and John Carter?
[Thought for 29 seconds]
The son of Dejah Thoris and John Carter is **Carthoris of Helium**.

> What are the major events in his life, in the order they happened?
[Thought for 227 seconds]
1) **Named "Carthoris" in childhood (a deliberate blend of his parents' names)**
- Key people/places: Carthoris; Dejah Thoris; John Carter; Helium
- Quote: "so the name that she called me is the one that you desired, a
  combination of hers and yours—Carthoris."

2) **Has a younger sister, Tara (family context established)**
- Key people/places: Carthoris; Tara of Helium; John Carter
- Quote: "'A daughter,' he replied, 'only a little younger than Carthoris,
  … Tara of Helium.'"

3) **Disappears (triggering prolonged grief and major search expeditions)**
- Key people/places: Carthoris; Dejah Thoris; Tardos Mors; Helium
- Quote: "Ever since Carthoris disappeared, Dejah Thoris has grieved and
  mourned for her lost boy."

...

21) **Develops the destination control compass, sparking a new era of invention**
- Key people/places: Carthoris; Barsoom's scientists/engineers; Helium
- Quote: "The perfection of the destination control compass by Carthoris
  of Helium… marked the beginning of a new era of invention."

...

30) **Later-life stability: Thuvia is his mate; he hunts in Okar with Talu**
- Key people/places: Carthoris; Thuvia of Ptarth; Talu (Jeddak of Okar)
- Quote: "Thuvia of Ptarth… while Carthoris, her mate, hunted in Okar."

### Noted conflict across sources
- **Thuvia's status** conflicts (promised to another vs. called his mate).
  Resolution: treated as narrative progression—first promised elsewhere,
  later described as his mate (implying circumstances changed).
```

The third question demonstrates RLM's strength for complex reasoning: it searched across all 7 novels (~2.8M characters), extracted 30 chronological events with supporting quotes, and identified a continuity conflict between books—the kind of long-context sequential analysis that typically trips up standard LLM approaches.
